NB: experimental, use at your own risk :-)

Creates an S3 backed up filesystem using yas3fs which is synced to a local volume which can then be mounted by other Docker containers for fun and profit.

Features

* Local volume continuously syncs to FUSE mounted S3 volume using rsync
* Local volume remains responsive and fast, but regularly updates to S3
* Local volume can be imported by other containers, S3 volume remains private
* Only syncs if local volume files have changed
* Simple quota system, stops files being copied to S3 volume once limit is reached
* File count limit, because this is all very, very slow :-)
* Daily/monthly tarball backups to S3
